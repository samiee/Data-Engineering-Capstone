# Data-Engineering-Capstone
 This repo show my work for Data Engineering Nanodegree Capstone 

 # Data and sources 
The following datasets are included in the project workspace. We purposely did not include a lot of detail about the data and instead point you to the sources. This is to help you get experience doing a self-guided project and researching the data yourself. If something about the data is unclear.
I94 Immigration Data: This data comes from the US National Tourism and Trade Office. A data dictionary is included in the workspace. This is where the data comes from. There's a sample file so you can take a look at the data in csv format before reading it all in. You do not have to use the entire dataset, just use what you need to accomplish the goal you set at the beginning of the project.
World Temperature Data: This dataset came from Kaggle. 
U.S. City Demographic Data: This data comes from OpenSoft. 
Airport Code Table: This is a simple table of airport codes and corresponding cities.

# Accessing the Data
Some of the data is already uploaded to the workspace, which you'll see in the navigation pane within Jupyter Lab. The immigration data and the global temperate data is in an attached disk.
